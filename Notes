 npm is used for when you want your things to be install inside for your project
 npx is just exactly npm but it is executing package without downloading it
npm manages the packages in your  project
package.json is configuraation for npm it keep tracks of what version of package install in ur system.
package lock.json keep tracks of exact version off all dependencies,it locks the version and it keeps the record of version

ther are 2 types of dependecncies  when we developing our app then we need dev depeneencies and normal dependencies use in production

node modules contains actual data of dependencies and packags
if we have package json and package lock json we can recreate our node modules even if it is deleted so we no need to put node modules on github and it is so huge.
